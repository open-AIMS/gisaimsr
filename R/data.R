#' Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning
#'
#' The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 (the Act) provides for the establishment, 
#' control, care and development of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (the Marine Park). 
#' The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (the Authority) is responsible for the 
#' management of the Marine Park. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003 is 
#' the primary planning instrument for the conservation and management of the Marine Park. 
#' In having regard to the objects set out in subsection 32 (7) of the Act, this Zoning Plan 
#' takes account of the world heritage values of the Marine Park and the principles of 
#' ecologically sustainable developments. This Zoning Plan aims, in conjunction with other 
#' management mechanisms, to protect and conserve the biodiversity of the Great Barrier 
#' Reef ecosystem within a network of highly protected zones, while providing opportunities 
#' for the ecologically sustainable use of, and access to, the Great Barrier Reef Region by 
#' current and future generations. In addition to the protection of representative areas of 
#' biodiversity, this Zoning Plan also provides for the protection of other areas of high 
#' conservation value by assigning protective zoning to a range of habitats such as coral reefs, 
#' sponge beds, seagrass beds and deep water areas, as well as important dugong habitats and 
#' other special or unique sites. The Marine Park is managed as a multiple use area. This means 
#' that, while enhancing the conservation of the Marine Park, this Zoning Plan also provides for 
#' a range of recreational, commercial and research opportunities, and for the continuation of 
#' traditional activities. This Zoning Plan expressly acknowledges the rights and interests of 
#' indigenous Australians in the Marine Park by providing for the management of the traditional 
#' use of marine resources, including traditional hunting, in accordance with Aboriginal and Torres 
#' Strait Islander custom and tradition. The contributions of scientific research to the management 
#' and understanding of the Marine Park are also acknowledged in this Zoning Plan, which provides 
#' for the management of research in the Marine Park, including a system of Scientific Research Zones 
#' to facilitate research around scientific research stations.(Extract from "Preface A, Introduction; 
#' Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003).
#' All data is based on the GDA2020 coordinate system.
